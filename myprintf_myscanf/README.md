# MyPrintf and MyScanf Project

Welcome to the **MyPrintf and MyScanf** project! This repository contains custom implementations of the `printf` and `scanf` functions in C. These implementations are designed to provide formatted output and input parsing capabilities, offering a deeper understanding of how these standard functions work.

## Overview

The **MyPrintf and MyScanf** project includes implementations of both `printf` and `scanf` in a single C file. The project demonstrates how to handle formatted output and input parsing using custom functions.

## Features

### MyPrintf

- **Custom Formatting**: Supports format specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%f`, and `%c`.
- **Variable Argument Handling**: Implements variadic functions to handle a variable number of arguments.
- **String Formatting**: Allows formatting of strings with specified width and precision.

### MyScanf

- **Custom Input Parsing**: Supports format specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%f`, and `%c`.
- **Variable Argument Handling**: Uses variadic functions to process input according to format specifiers.
- **Input Validation**: Handles and validates user input to match specified formats.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
