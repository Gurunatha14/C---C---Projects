# Number Conversion Projec

Welcome to the **Number Conversion** project! This project is a C-based application designed to convert numbers between different formats, such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. It is intended as an educational tool for understanding number systems and conversions.

## Overview

The **Number Conversion** project provides a command-line interface for converting numbers between various bases. It supports conversion in the following formats:
- Binary
- Decimal
- Octal
- Hexadecimal

## Features

- **Multi-base Conversion**: Convert numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems.
- **User Input Handling**: Process and validate user inputs for accurate conversions.
- **Error Handling**: Handle invalid inputs and display appropriate error messages.
